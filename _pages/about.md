## Career Goals

Advances in chemical engineering have been integral to the success and expansion of the global oil and gas industry, enabling the fossil-fuel-run society we experience today. As a chemical engineer, I hope to embrace a new era of sustainability-driven chemical engineering that combines the technological development of sustainable green processes with relevant policy to accelerate our transition away from a petrochemical-fueled globe and improve global health. 

In pursuing this career goal, I have strived to achieve academic excellence in my technical courses. I have also made a strong effort to enrich my education with global perspectives on sustainability, policy, and development through courses including Sustainable Engineering and Human Geography.

Through my research, I have turned many of the technical concepts I have learned into actionable skills. I am always in pursuit of acquiring more skills and expertise that I will be able to dedicate to my work to ultimately benefit environmental and human health globally.
